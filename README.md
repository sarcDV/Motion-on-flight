Classification of Motion Corrupted Brain MR Images using Deep Learning Techniques

test motion correction/classification 

Introduction

Despite continuing efforts in solving the problem of motion artifacts in MRI, 
subject motion remains one of themajor sources of image degradation [1], 
in research applications and more importantly, in clinical routine acquisitions. 
It is fundamental to differentiate between images with an acceptable level of motion corruption and those that cannot be used for diagnosis and require rescanning [2-3]. The quality assessment is done visually by the radiographer or the technician. It requires additional time and is biased by the subjective quality perception. We comparatively evaluate two deep learning techniques for automatic classification of the level of motion artifacts. We aim at providing a supplementary tool that assists the clinicians in image quality assessment.Subjects/MethodsFor this work, images of 29 healthy subjects acquired at 3T were used. 
Our dataset comprises T1, T2, PD and T2-FLAIR images with different orientation and resolution, Fig. 1.
